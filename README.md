# AWS-Hands-On-Learning-and-Experience
You will learn about the AWS offers a wide range of cloud services across compute, storage, databases, networking, and security. Compute services like EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, and Fargate support everything from virtual servers to serverless and containerized applications.
Storage solutions such as S3, EBS, EFS, and Glacier enable scalable object, block, and archival storage, while database options like RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, ElastiCache, and Redshift support relational, NoSQL, caching, and analytics needs. Networking tools including VPC, Route 53, CloudFront, API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing manage traffic, DNS, content delivery, and APIs. Security and identity are handled by IAM, KMS, Cognito, GuardDuty, WAF, Shield, and Secrets Manager. Monitoring and DevOps workflows are powered by CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, Systems Manager, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. Analytics and AI services like Athena, Glue, Kinesis, EMR, QuickSight, SageMaker, Rekognition, and Comprehend enable big data processing, real-time streaming, and machine learning. Migration solutions such as DMS, DataSync, and Snowball simplify data transfer, while Cost Explorer and Budgets help manage cloud spending. IoT services like IoT Core and Greengrass enable secure device connectivity and edge computing.
